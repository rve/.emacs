#My .emacs.d 

##About

A minimal structured .emacs.d based on Purcell's, for I don't write web programs much.

##Install

Clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d`, make sure `init.el` ends in `~/.emacs.d/init.el`.  
Upon first start, third party packages will be automatically installed which may take some time.
